    The Civil Engineering division of St. Josephâ€™s Centre for Industrial Consultancy believe in providing 
    value-added construction services to our customers by creating a successful partnership with them
    throughout the construction process. Our highly qualified, theoretically equipped as well as practically 
    experienced staff uphold the idea of creating the most economical and safest design by using the most
    advanced computer packages, rather than using the traditional thumb rule design methodology.
